📊 Data Visualization Plots Notebook (Plots.ipynb)This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook (Plots.ipynb) designed to serve as a hands-on guide and reference for essential data visualization techniques using the Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly libraries in Python.It is an ideal resource for data science beginners, analysts, and students looking to quickly understand, implement, and customize common chart types for both static and interactive reporting.🚀 Getting StartedTo run and interact with this notebook, you will need a Python environment configured with the necessary libraries.PrerequisitesPython 3.xJupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (or use a cloud environment like Google Colab)InstallationYou can install the required libraries using pip:pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
UsageOpen the Notebook: Navigate to the directory containing Plots.ipynb and run:jupyter notebook
Run Cells: Execute the cells sequentially to see the code, the generated plots, and the explanations in action.📘 Notebook ContentsThe Plots.ipynb notebook is structured into three main sections, covering different approaches to data visualization in Python.1. Matplotlib (Foundational Plotting)This section covers the fundamental building blocks of plotting, focusing on the basics of creating figures, axes, and customizing individual elements.Barchart: Creating and customizing bar plots for categorical data.Line chart: Visualizing trends over a continuous variable (e.g., time series data).Histogram: Understanding distribution and frequency of numerical data.Scatter plot: Exploring relationships and correlations between two numerical variables.2. Seaborn (Statistical Visualization)This section demonstrates how to use the high-level Seaborn library to create statistically informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, often built on top of Matplotlib.Distribution Plots:Histograms (with KDE overlays)Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) PlotsRelational Plots:Scatter Plot (relplot)Line Plot (lineplot)Categorical Plots:Bar Plots (barplot)Count Plots (countplot)Box Plots (boxplot) - Summarizing distribution via quartiles.Violin Plots (violinplot) - Combining box plots with density estimation.Matrix Plots:Heatmap (heatmap) - Visualizing matrix data, such as correlation tables.Multi-Variable Plots:Pairplot (pairplot) - Plotting pairwise relationships across an entire DataFrame.3. Plotly (Interactive Visualization)This section introduces the Plotly library for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations suitable for web embedding and dashboarding.Basic Interactive Charts:Scatter PlotsLine ChartsBar ChartsAdvanced Features:3D Scatter Plots (for multi-dimensional data)Pie/Donut ChartsBuilt-in Interactivity: Demonstrations of zoom, pan, hover tooltips, and saving plots as images.🤝 ContributingIf you find an error, have suggestions for new plot types, or want to improve the existing code or explanations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
